# myNotes
This is a repo that contains my notes I take during the learning proccess of any course I see worth sharing.   
Till this momemnt I share the **Academic** notes that I take during my undergraduate years at the German University in Cairo. 
## Contributions ?
Well, I see that this is kind of a personal knowledge that I create with my own way and style, So, if there is any wrong information or mistakes found in the notes (and of course there will be), you can contact me and I will try my best to correct them all.

Other than that, you can easily fork the repo and add/edit your own little details :)

I'll be happy to recieve any feedback.
